/**
 * WorkflowManager
 * Centralized service for managing officer workflow state, proactive suggestions, and next-step logic.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Track officer's current situation, recent actions, and workflow state.
 * - Suggest next logical actions (e.g., Miranda after apprehension, report after Miranda).
 * - Integrate with context, OrchestratorService, and DecisionEngine.
 * - Expose methods for UI and backend to query and update workflow state.
 * - Support multi-tenant (orgId/userId) partitioning.
 * 
 * Planned Methods:
 * - getCurrentWorkflowState(orgId: string, userId: string): WorkflowState
 * - updateWorkflowState(orgId: string, userId: string, update: Partial<WorkflowState>): void
 * - suggestNextActions(orgId: string, userId: string): SuggestedAction[]
 * - resetWorkflow(orgId: string, userId: string): void
 * - handleEvent(orgId: string, userId: string, event: WorkflowEvent): void
 * 
 * TODO:
 * - Define WorkflowState, SuggestedAction, WorkflowEvent types.
 * - Implement state persistence (in-memory, localStorage, or backend).
 * - Integrate with OrchestratorService and UI.
