# Supabase Integration Plan

This document outlines the steps and best practices for integrating Supabase into your project, covering authentication, database, storage, realtime subscriptions, edge functions, and vector search.

---

## 1. Install Supabase JS Client

Install the official Supabase client library:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

---

## 2. Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `.env` file (do **not** commit secrets):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

- Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard under Project Settings â†’ API.

---

## 3. Project Structure & Integration

### a. Supabase Client Initialization

Create a single file for initializing the Supabase client, e.g. `src/services/supabaseClient.ts`:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

### b. Authentication

- Use Supabase Auth for user sign up, login, social providers, passwordless, etc.
- Integrate with your existing auth context/provider or replace as needed.
- Protect routes/components based on auth state.

### c. Database (Postgres)

- Use Supabase client to read/write data.
- Define tables and relationships in the Supabase dashboard.
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) for fine-grained access control.
- Use Supabase's auto-generated REST or GraphQL API as needed.

### d. Storage

- Use Supabase Storage for file uploads/downloads.
- Store file metadata (URLs, types, etc.) in your database tables.

### e. Realtime Subscriptions

- Use Supabase Realtime to subscribe to changes in tables (e.g., chat, incidents).
- Update UI in real time as data changes.

### f. Edge Functions

- Write custom backend logic in TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Deploy via the Supabase dashboard or CLI.
- Use for webhooks, custom APIs, or integrating with external services.

### g. Vector Search

- Use Supabase's vector extension for AI/ML features (semantic search, recommendations).
- Store and query vector embeddings in your database.
- Integrate with OpenAI or other embedding providers as needed.

## 4. Security & Best Practices

- **Never expose service_role or secret keys in frontend code.**
- Use environment variables for all credentials.
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) and write policies for all tables.
- Validate and sanitize all user input.
- Use HTTPS for all API calls.

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. Install the Supabase client (`npm install @supabase/supabase-js`).
2. Add your Supabase credentials to `.env`.
3. Create `src/services/supabaseClient.ts` as shown above.
4. Integrate Supabase Auth into your auth flow.
5. Migrate data models to Supabase/Postgres as needed.
6. Set up storage buckets and file upload logic.
7. Implement realtime subscriptions for collaborative features.
8. Write and deploy edge functions for custom backend logic.
9. Set up vector search for AI/ML features if needed.
10. Test thoroughly and review security policies.
