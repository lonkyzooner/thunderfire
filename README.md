## Deploying to Vercel

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/b0cde990-0f31-4c17-aa32-3beb1cc2d015) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

### Vercel Deployment Instructions

1. Push your code to GitHub
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Create a Vercel account at https://vercel.com
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Configure project settings

3. Set Environment Variables in Vercel
   - In your Vercel project settings, go to the "Environment Variables" tab
   - Add the following environment variables:

   ```
   VITE_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://lark-za4hpayr.livekit.cloud
   ```
   > **Note:** For translation/statute features, the OpenRouter API key is required in the frontend code. This is less secure, but necessary for frontend-only deployments. Do not commit sensitive keys to git for production use.
   >
   > The app is now frontend-only for translation/statute features. All translation and statute analysis is performed via direct calls to the OpenRouter API from the browser.

4. Deploy your application
   - Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete
   - Your app will be available at the provided Vercel URL
