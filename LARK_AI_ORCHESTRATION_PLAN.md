# LARK AI Orchestration & Enhancement Plan
## Next Phase: Building Intelligent AI Coordination

### Executive Summary
This plan addresses LARK's current over-reliance on OpenAI by implementing an intelligent AI orchestration layer that coordinates multiple models, provides enhanced offline capabilities, and creates context-aware AI coordination for superior law enforcement assistance.

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working Well
- **OpenAI Integration**: Solid GPT-4 implementation for command processing
- **Multi-Client Infrastructure**: Multiple LLM clients already implemented (Claude, Groq, Gemini, Cohere)
- **Voice Services**: LiveKit integration with OpenAI TTS working well
- **Command Context**: Basic command context and analytics tracking

### Critical Gaps
1. **Single Point of Failure**: 95% dependency on OpenAI
2. **No AI Orchestration**: Services operate in isolation
3. **Disabled Offline Capabilities**: Whisper service is stubbed out
4. **Underutilized Infrastructure**: Multiple LLM clients exist but unused
5. **Limited Context Awareness**: No cross-service context sharing
6. **No Model Specialization**: One-size-fits-all approach

## Recommended "Brains" Architecture

### Phase 1: AI Orchestration Layer (Month 1-2)

#### 1. Intelligent Model Router
```typescript
// New: src/services/ai/AIOrchestrator.ts
class AIOrchestrator {
  // Route requests to optimal model based on:
  // - Request type (legal, tactical, general)
  // - Model availability/latency
  // - Cost optimization
  // - Context requirements
}
```

**Implementation Priority:**
- **Primary Brain**: Keep OpenAI GPT-4 for complex reasoning
- **Speed Brain**: Use Groq for fast responses (routine queries)
- **Specialized Brain**: Claude for legal analysis, Gemini for real-time data
- **Offline Brain**: Enable Whisper for speech-to-text without internet

#### 2. Enhanced Context Management
```typescript
// Enhanced: src/services/ContextManager.ts
class EnhancedContextManager {
  // Cross-service context sharing
  // Conversation memory across AI models
  // Officer profile and preference tracking
  // Incident-specific context retention
}
```

#### 3. Multi-Model Command Processing
Instead of routing everything through OpenAI, implement intelligent routing:

**High-Priority Commands (Sub-second response needed):**
- Miranda rights → Local templates + Groq for customization
- Radio codes → Local database lookup
- Basic statutes → Local cache + fast model

**Complex Analysis (Quality over speed):**
- Threat assessment → GPT-4 or Claude
- Legal interpretation → Claude (better at nuanced legal reasoning)
- Tactical planning → GPT-4 with specialized prompts

**Real-time Data (Current information needed):**
- Location queries → Gemini (better Google integration)
- Current events → Gemini or live data APIs

### Phase 2: Specialized Capabilities (Month 2-3)

#### 1. Enable Offline Intelligence
**Replace stub WhisperService with full implementation:**
```typescript
// Enhanced: src/services/whisper/WhisperService.ts
class WhisperService {
  // Local speech-to-text processing
  // Works without internet
  // Optimized for law enforcement terminology
  // Emergency command recognition
}
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Model Fine-tuning
**Create LARK-specific model adaptations:**
- Fine-tune smaller models on law enforcement data
- Create specialized prompts for different AI services
- Implement law enforcement terminology optimization

#### 3. Intelligent Fallback System
```typescript
// New: src/services/ai/FallbackManager.ts
class FallbackManager {
  // Primary → Secondary → Offline progression
  // Automatic failover with quality maintenance
  // User notification of service degradation
}
```

## Specific Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)

1. **Implement AIOrchestrator service**
   - Route commands based on complexity and urgency
   - Start with simple rule-based routing
   - Add machine learning optimization later

2. **Enable Whisper Service**
   - Replace stub with full Whisper implementation
   - Focus on emergency command recognition
   - Ensure offline capability for critical situations

3. **Create Model Specialization Map**
   ```typescript
   const modelStrategy = {
     legal_analysis: ['claude-3-opus', 'gpt-4'],
     fast_responses: ['groq-mixtral', 'gpt-3.5-turbo'],
     real_time_data: ['gemini-pro', 'gpt-4'],
     offline_critical: ['local-whisper', 'local-templates']
   };
   ```

### Medium-term Enhancements (Month 2-3)

1. **Multi-Model Conversation Handling**
   - Allow different models to handle different parts of conversation
   - Maintain context across model switches

   - Predictive threat assessment
   - Contextual information pre-loading

3. **Enhanced Voice Pipeline**
   - Multiple TTS voices for different content types
   - Faster voice synthesis for urgent communications
   - Voice cloning for consistent officer experience

### Advanced Features (Month 3+)

1. **Federated AI Learning**
   - Learn from officer interactions across models
   - Improve routing decisions over time
   - Personalized AI behavior per officer

2. **Edge AI Deployment**
   - On-device models for critical functions
